# Personal lifestyle changes and habits I use to push myself forward

## Day 0

### TBH I am a completely lazy person , these days we have lockdown due to COVID-19 and I have been spending like 12 hrs per day on gaming while the rest on sleeping/zoom classes

### Today I will start with 1 change

1. When I am out and about for coding, I will set a timer of 40 mins, each 40 mins focus on 1 task , then 10 mins break and then 40 mins of back to coding

2. I will atleast have 4 batches of 40 min sessions each day , despite any odd
